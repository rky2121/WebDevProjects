# Web Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of web development projects I built during Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp.  
These projects helped me practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals as well as responsive design techniques.

## Projects Included

- **HoverButton**  
  A project showcasing CSS hover effects on buttons to improve user interface interactivity.

- **MuseumOfCandy**  
  A responsive website layout project focused on styling and structuring content for a fictional candy museum.

- **PhotoBlogCode**  
  A simple photo blog webpage demonstrating layout techniques and image presentation.

- **PriceTable**  
  A pricing table component created with CSS to display different plans pricing options clearly.

- **Pokémon Images Demo**  
  A small JavaScript demo that dynamically loads and displays images of the first 151 Pokémon with their corresponding numbers.  
  Demonstrates DOM element creation and appending images and labels inside a container dynamically.
